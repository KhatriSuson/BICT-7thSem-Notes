# üìö Unit II: Society and Culture  

## üìñ Overview  
Unit II dives into the **diverse elements** that shape society and culture, from **pluralism** (‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§∏‡§æ‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§ø‡§ï‡§§‡§æ) to **new social movements** (‡§®‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Å ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ú‡§ø‡§ï ‡§Ü‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ã‡§≤‡§®). It helps us understand how cultural identity is formed and how social forces challenge, shape, and sustain those identities. In this unit, we‚Äôll explore critical themes such as **cultural pluralism** (‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§∏‡§æ‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§ø‡§ï‡§§‡§æ), **social movements** (‡§∏‡§æ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ú‡§ø‡§ï ‡§Ü‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ã‡§≤‡§®), **personal empowerment** (‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§ó‡§§ ‡§∏‡§∂‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§ï‡§∞‡§£), and **ethnicity** (‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡•Ä‡§Ø‡§§‡§æ).

## üîç Key Concepts & Real-Life Examples  

### **2.1 Cultural Pluralism versus Culture in Singular**  
**Cultural pluralism** (‡§¨‡§π‡•Å‡§∏‡§æ‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§ø‡§ï‡§§‡§æ) refers to a society where multiple distinct cultural groups coexist and maintain their unique cultural identities. On the other hand, **monoculturalism** (‡§∏‡§æ‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§ø‡§ï ‡§è‡§ï‡§§‡§æ) refers to a society that promotes or enforces a single culture as dominant.  

üìù **Real-Life Example:**  
In the **United States**, cultural pluralism is seen in how various ethnic groups (e.g., African Americans, Latinx, Asian Americans) maintain their cultural traditions while contributing to the broader national identity, such as in celebrations like **Chinese New Year** and **Thanksgiving**.  

### **2.2 New Social Movements**  
New social movements (NSMs) focus on issues like **environmentalism** (‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§µ‡§∞‡§£‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶), **feminism** (‡§®‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶), and **LGBTQ+ rights** (‡§è‡§≤‡§ú‡•Ä‡§¨‡•Ä‡§ü‡•Ä‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç+ ‡§Ö‡§ß‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞), often emerging in response to the failures of traditional political institutions.  

üìù **Real-Life Example:**  
**Fridays for Future** led by **Greta Thunberg** is an example of a modern **new social movement** (‡§®‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Å ‡§∏‡§æ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ú‡§ø‡§ï ‡§Ü‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ã‡§≤‡§®), where young people globally protest against climate inaction, demanding governments take responsibility for environmental justice.

### **2.3 Mould Your Own Destiny**  
This concept highlights the power of **self-determination** (‡§Ü‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§Ø), emphasizing that individuals can shape their futures through choices, perseverance, and mindset.  

üìù **Real-Life Example:**  
Consider **Oprah Winfrey‚Äôs** story. Born into poverty, she worked hard to overcome significant challenges and built a media empire, showing the importance of **personal empowerment** (‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§ó‡§§ ‡§∏‡§∂‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§ï‡§∞‡§£) and the idea that anyone can mold their own destiny.

### **2.4 Levis**  
Levis, as a brand, became a **symbol of American culture** (‡§Ö‡§Æ‡•á‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§ø), particularly tied to the **working class** (‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ‡•Ä ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó) and later, **youth countercultures** (‡§Ø‡•Å‡§µ‡§æ‡§ì‡§Ç‡§ï‡§æ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∞‡•ã‡§ß‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§ø). The blue jean, a simple garment, symbolizes much more than just clothing‚Äîit‚Äôs a cultural artifact.  

üìù **Real-Life Example:**  
The Levis brand became iconic when it was adopted by the **counterculture movement** (‡§µ‡§ø‡§∞‡•ã‡§ß‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§ø ‡§Ü‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ã‡§≤‡§®) of the 1960s. Young people associated **Levi‚Äôs jeans** with rebellion, freedom, and authenticity, making it a powerful cultural symbol beyond its commercial identity.

### **2.5 Who is Ethnic**  
This section explores the concept of **ethnicity** (‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡•Ä‡§Ø‡§§‡§æ)‚Äîthe shared cultural traits, language, and heritage that connect people. But what does it mean to be ‚Äúethnic‚Äù in today‚Äôs globalized world?  

üìù **Real-Life Example:**  
The term **‚Äúethnic foods‚Äù** (‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡•Ä‡§Ø ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ) has changed over time‚Äîwhat was once considered ‚Äúethnic‚Äù food (like **Mexican tacos** or **Indian curry**) is now enjoyed by people from all cultures. This shift reflects a more global and inclusive definition of ethnicity.

### **2.6 Sherpas and their Dangerous Job on Mount Everest**  
Sherpas (‡§∂‡•á‡§∞‡•ç‡§™‡§æ) are a **Nepalese ethnic group** (‡§®‡•á‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡•Ä‡§Ø ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§π) famous for their role as guides on **Mount Everest expeditions** (‡§è‡§µ‡§∞‡•á‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü ‡§Ö‡§≠‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®). Their work, though critical, is often dangerous and demanding, highlighting both their physical prowess and cultural significance.  

üìù **Real-Life Example:**  
Sherpas risk their lives during **Everest expeditions** (‡§è‡§µ‡§∞‡•á‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü ‡§Ö‡§≠‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®), carrying heavy loads and leading climbers up treacherous paths. Despite their vital role, their stories are often overshadowed by the fame of the mountaineers themselves.

### **2.7 Numafung**  
**Numafung** (‡§®‡•Å‡§Æ‡§æ‡§´‡•Å‡§ô) is a traditional **folk hero** (‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï ‡§®‡§æ‡§Ø‡§ï) from the Tibetan region, embodying themes of **courage, loyalty, and sacrifice**. This figure serves as a symbol of cultural storytelling and the **preservation of heritage** (‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§ø‡§ï‡•ã ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∞‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§£).  

üìù **Real-Life Example:**  
The story of **Numafung** (‡§®‡•Å‡§Æ‡§æ‡§´‡•Å‡§ô) is shared among Tibetan communities and resonates with the ideals of **selflessness** (‡§®‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§•‡§§‡§æ) and the need to protect one‚Äôs culture and values. These stories serve to connect generations and preserve cultural identity in the face of modernity.
