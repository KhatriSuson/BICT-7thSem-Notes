# **Unit 2: Control Statements in Python**

Control statements guide the flow of execution in a Python program. This unit explores how to make decisions, repeat actions, and control loops effectively.

## **2.1 `if` Statement**
The `if` statement allows conditional execution of code blocks based on logical expressions.

- **Syntax:**
  ```python
  if condition:
      # Code to execute if condition is True
  elif another_condition:
      # Code to execute if another_condition is True
  else:
      # Code to execute if all conditions are False

# Example 
* num = 10
* if num > 0:
    * print("Positive number")
* elif num < 0:
    * print("Negative number")
* else:
    * print("Zero")
