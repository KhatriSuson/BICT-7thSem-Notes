# **Unit 2: Control Statements in Python**

Control statements guide the flow of execution in a Python program. This unit explores how to make decisions, repeat actions, and control loops effectively.

---

## **2.1 `if` Statement**
The `if` statement allows conditional execution of code blocks based on logical expressions.

- **Syntax:**
  ```python
  if condition:
      # Code to execute if condition is True
  elif another_condition:
      # Code to execute if another_condition is True
  else:
      # Code to execute if all conditions are False

# **Unit 2: Control Statements in Python**

This unit explains how to control the flow of execution in Python programs using conditional and looping statements.

---

## **2.1 `if` Statement**
The `if` statement allows a program to execute a block of code based on a specific condition. It can include multiple conditions using `elif` and a fallback using `else`.

---

## **2.2 `match` Statement**
The `match` statement (introduced in Python 3.10) is used for pattern matching. It works like a switch-case structure in other programming languages, enabling clear decision-making based on multiple potential values.

---

## **2.3 `break` Statement**
The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely when a specific condition is met. It halts the loop's execution and moves control to the next statement outside the loop.

---

## **2.4 `continue` Statement**
The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration, avoiding any subsequent code within the loop for the current cycle.

---

## **2.5 Loop Statements**

### **2.5.1 `while` Loop**
The `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as the specified condition remains `True`. It is commonly used when the number of iterations is unknown.

---

### **2.5.2 `for` Loop**
The `for` loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, string, or range) and executes a block of code for each element. It is ideal for scenarios where the number of iterations is predetermined.

---

## **2.6 Nested Loop**
Nested loops are loops within loops. They allow iteration over multi-dimensional data structures or complex patterns of repetition.

---

## **2.7 Infinite Loop**
An infinite loop continues executing indefinitely until explicitly stopped, usually using a `break` statement. Without a termination condition, it can cause a program to hang or crash.

---

## **Summary**
- Use control statements like `if` and `match` for decision-making.
- Use `break` and `continue` to alter the flow within loops.
- Use `while` for condition-based repetition and `for` for iterating sequences.
- Avoid infinite loops unless intentionally used for specific scenarios.
