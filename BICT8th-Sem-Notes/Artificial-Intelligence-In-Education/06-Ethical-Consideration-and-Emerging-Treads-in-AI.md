## 🗂️ Course Content

### 6.1 Ethical Considerations in AI

| Concern     | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Bias**    | Algorithms may reflect or amplify societal biases if trained on biased data |
| **Privacy** | Student data may be misused or insufficiently protected |
| **Equity**  | Unequal access to AI tools may widen educational gaps |

#### 🔍 Example:
- An AI grading system might give lower scores to non-native English speakers due to biased training data.
- Facial recognition tools may misidentify students from underrepresented groups.
