## 🗂️ Course Content

### 4.1 Overview of Machine Learning

#### 🔸 What is Machine Learning?
> Machine Learning is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.

#### 🔸 Types of Learning Paradigms:

| Type             | Description | Example in Education |
|------------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| **Supervised**   | Learn from labeled data (input-output pairs) | Predicting grades from past scores |
| **Unsupervised** | Discover patterns in unlabeled data | Grouping students based on behavior |
| **Reinforcement**| Learn by trial and error with rewards | Personalized learning paths through AI tutors |

### 4.2 Basics of Neural Networks

#### 🔸 Components of a Neural Network

- **Input Layer**: Receives raw features (e.g., scores, attendance)
- **Hidden Layers**: Process and learn complex patterns
- **Output Layer**: Provides predictions (e.g., pass/fail)

#### 🔸 Key Terms:
- **Neuron (Node)**: Basic unit of computation
- **Weights & Biases**: Adjusted during training
- **Activation Function**: Introduces non-linearity (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid)
- **Backpropagation**: Optimization technique to reduce error

#### 🔸 Educational Applications:
- Predicting dropout risk  
- Student performance analysis  
- Personalized feedback systems
