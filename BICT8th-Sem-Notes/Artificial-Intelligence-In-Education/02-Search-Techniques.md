### 📌 Unit 2: Knowledge and Learning Agents

#### ✅ Knowledge Representation:

- Method of structuring knowledge so that machines can use it.
- Common techniques: semantic networks, logic rules, ontologies.

> **Example:** Representing subject prerequisites using semantic networks.

---

#### ✅ Learning Agents:

A **learning agent** is a type of software that:
- Perceives its environment,
- Learns from interactions,
- Improves performance over time.

**Components:**
- **Learning element**
- **Performance element**
- **Critic**
- **Problem generator**

> **Real Example:** Carnegie Learning’s MATHia adapts instruction based on student mistakes.
