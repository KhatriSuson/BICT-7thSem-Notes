## üóÇÔ∏è Course Content

### 5.1 Overview of NLP

#### üî∏ What is NLP?

> **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a branch of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

#### üî∏ Core NLP Tasks:

| Task                | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Parsing**         | Analyzing sentence structure (syntax) |
| **Text Classification** | Categorizing text (e.g., emails, documents) into predefined groups |
| **Sentiment Analysis** | Identifying emotional tone behind text (positive/negative/neutral) |

#### üî∏ Key Terminologies:
- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into words or sentences  
- **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their root form  
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying names, dates, locations, etc.  
- **POS Tagging**: Identifying parts of speech (noun, verb, etc.)

### 5.2 Applications in Education

| Application         | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Chatbots**        | NLP-based assistants for answering FAQs or supporting students |
| **Automated Grading** | Grading short answers or essays using NLP models |
| **Virtual Assistants** | Tools like Alexa or Google Assistant used in learning contexts |

#### üî∏ Example:
- A chatbot that helps students with exam dates, assignment deadlines, or course FAQs.
- Sentiment analysis on student feedback forms.

## üß™ Practical Work

### 1. ü§ñ Create a Basic Chatbot Using NLTK or Hugging Face

#### üìå Tools:
- **NLTK**: Python library for basic NLP (tokenization, stemming, etc.)
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Pretrained NLP models like BERT or GPT for smarter responses

#### üìå Example Project:
> Build a chatbot that can respond to questions like:
> - "When is the final exam?"
> - "How do I submit Assignment 3?"

- Use intent classification and rule-based or pretrained models
- Optional: Deploy with Flask for a simple web UI
