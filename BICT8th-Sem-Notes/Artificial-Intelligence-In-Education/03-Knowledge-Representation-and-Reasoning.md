## 🗂️ Course Content

### 3.1 Propositional and Predicate Logic

#### 🔹 Topics:
- **Syntax**: symbols, variables, operators (¬, ∧, ∨, →)
- **Semantics**: truth values, interpretations
- **Inference**: Forward chaining, backward chaining

#### 🔹 Key Definitions:
- **Propositional Logic**: Uses propositions and connectives. Example:  
  `P ∧ Q → R`  
- **Predicate Logic**: Uses quantifiers, variables, and predicates. Example:  
  `∀x (Student(x) → Studies(x))`

#### 🔹 Example:
If "All students study" and "Ram is a student", then we infer "Ram studies."

### 3.2 Rule-Based Systems and Statistical Reasoning

#### 🔹 Topics:
- **Rule-based systems**: Use IF-THEN rules to model decision logic  
- **Inference**:
  - **Forward chaining**: Data → rules → conclusion
  - **Backward chaining**: Goal → rules → data needed

#### 🔹 Statistical Reasoning:
- **Probability**: Measuring likelihood of an event  
- **Bayes’ Theorem**:
  > `P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)`  
- **Belief Networks**: Probabilistic graphical models representing conditional dependencies

---

### 3.3 Applications in Education

#### 🔹 Topics:
- **Automated Grading Systems**: Grade based on logic or probability
- **Lesson Planning**: Recommend lessons based on learner profile
- **Career Counseling Expert Systems**: Suggest career paths using rules and data

#### 🔹 Examples:
- IF student interest = "Science" AND grades > 80%, THEN suggest "Engineering"
- Grading: IF correct answer = A AND student answer = A, THEN full marks

## 🧪 Practical Work

### 1. 🧮 Logic Evaluator (Truth Tables)
- Build a truth table evaluator for expressions like `P ∧ Q → R`
- Output: Validity, satisfiability

### 2. 🤖 Expert System (Career Counseling)
- Input: grades, interests
- Use IF-THEN rules to suggest fields like "Science", "Arts", "Engineering"

### 3. 📝 Automated Grading System
- Logic-based grading for MCQs or short answers
- Extend to use **probability** for uncertain answers (e.g., partially correct)

## 📝 Exam Preparation Notes

### ✅ Must-Know Concepts

| Concept                | Explanation / Example |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Propositional Logic** | Logic without quantifiers (e.g., `P → Q`) |
| **Predicate Logic**     | Includes quantifiers and predicates (e.g., `∀x Student(x)`) |
| **Forward Chaining**    | Starts from known facts → applies rules |
| **Backward Chaining**   | Starts from goal → checks supporting facts |
| **Rule-based Systems**  | IF-THEN rules to simulate decisions |
| **Bayesian Networks**   | Probabilistic models to handle uncertainty |
