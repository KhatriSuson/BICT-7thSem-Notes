# Unit 3: Instructional Planning

## Specific Objectives

- Justify the **need of teaching plans** and how lesson structuring supports student learning.  
- Describe the **different types of instructional plans** (annual, unit, daily).  
- Prepare **samples of instructional plans** based on various levels.  
- Prepare a **sample of an Individualized Education Plan (IEP)** for diverse learners.

## 3.1 Need for Plan and Lesson Structuring

### Why Planning is Important

- Ensures **clarity of learning goals** and objectives.  
- Helps teachers organize **content, methods, materials, and assessments** effectively.  
- Encourages **confidence and preparedness** during lesson delivery.  
- Reduces classroom management problems and enhances **student engagement**.

### Phases of Lesson Structuring

1. **Preparatory Phase**  
   - Setting objectives  
   - Preparing materials/resources  
   - Understanding learners' prior knowledge  
   *Example:* A science teacher checks students' understanding of living vs. non-living things before starting classification.

2. **Delivery Phase**  
   - Presenting content using methods like lectures, group work, Q&A.  
   - Using teaching aids (charts, digital tools).  
   - Active student participation.  
   *Example:* In a math class, the teacher introduces fractions using paper folding and real-life food examples.

3. **Consolidation Phase**  
   - Summarizing key points  
   - Assigning practice/homework  
   - Assessment or feedback  
   *Example:* At the end of an English class, students write a short paragraph using newly learned vocabulary.

## 3.2 Types of Instructional Plans

### 1. **Annual Plan**
- Covers **whole academic year**.
- Divides curriculum into months or terms.
- Sets a **broad roadmap** for teachers.

📝 *Real-life example:* A Nepali teacher prepares a chart showing when to teach grammar, essay writing, and literature over 10 months.

### 2. **Unit Plan**
- Covers a **specific chapter or theme** from the curriculum.
- Details learning outcomes, methods, and evaluation for the unit.
- Bridges between annual and daily planning.

📝 *Real-life example:* A science teacher creates a unit plan for “Plants” including objectives, group activities, experiments, and quizzes.

### 3. **Daily Lesson Plan**
- Specific plan for **a single classroom session**.
- Contains objectives, materials, step-by-step procedures, and assessments.

📝 *Real-life example:* A math teacher writes a lesson plan on addition, using coins, a whiteboard, and a worksheet, with expected learning outcomes.

## 3.3 Individualized Education Plan (IEP)

### What is an IEP?

An **Individualized Education Plan** is a customized instructional plan designed to meet the unique needs of a learner, especially those with disabilities or learning difficulties.

### Key Features

- Personalized goals  
- Tailored teaching methods and materials  
- Continuous monitoring and feedback  
- Involvement of parents, teachers, and sometimes health professionals

📝 *Real-life example:* A student with dyslexia receives an IEP that includes extra time for reading tasks, the use of audio books, and simplified instructions.
