# Unit 4: Teacher-Centered Methods

## Specific Objectives

- Explain when **teacher-centered methods** are most effective.  
- Describe various types of **teacher-centered teaching methods**.  
- Prepare a **sample lesson plan** using teacher-centered approaches.  
- Present a **sample lesson plan** in the classroom confidently.

---

## When to Use Teacher-Centered Methods

Teacher-centered methods are most effective when:

- Introducing **new or complex concepts** for the first time.  
- The classroom has **limited resources or large student numbers**.  
- **Time is limited**, and direct delivery is necessary for coverage.  
- Students need **clear explanations, demonstrations, or structure**.  
- Classroom discipline or focus is required.

📝 *Real-life example:*  
In a Grade 9 science class, a teacher introduces Newton’s Laws of Motion using a structured explanation and demonstration, ensuring students understand the formulas before applying them.

---

## 4.1 Direct Instruction

### What It Is:
- A structured, clear, and systematic method where the teacher explicitly teaches concepts.
- Includes demonstration, explanation, guided practice, and feedback.

### Key Features:
- Highly organized lessons  
- Teacher talks; students listen, observe, take notes  
- Best for factual and procedural knowledge

📝 *Example:* Teaching a math formula step-by-step and asking students to repeat the process with different problems.

---

## 4.2 Concept Teaching

### What It Is:
- Teaching aimed at helping students understand **categories, ideas, and principles** through examples and non-examples.

### Steps:
1. Define the concept  
2. Give examples and non-examples  
3. Engage students in identifying or applying the concept  
4. Assess understanding

📝 *Example:* Teaching the concept of “democracy” by comparing it with “dictatorship” using real-world examples like Nepal vs. North Korea.

---

## 4.3 Presenting and Explaining

### What It Is:
- The teacher provides **verbal explanation or visual presentation** of information.
- Often supported with **charts, diagrams, videos, or realia**.

### Tips:
- Use clear language and logical sequencing  
- Provide visual aids where possible  
- Check for understanding during/after explanation

📝 *Example:* A teacher explains the water cycle using diagrams and animation, highlighting each stage like evaporation, condensation, and precipitation.

## 4.4 Sample Lesson Plan (Teacher-Centered)

### Format:

| Element               | Description                                               |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Topic**             | Types of Triangles                                         |
| **Objective**         | Students will be able to identify and define triangle types |
| **Materials**         | Chart paper, ruler, whiteboard                            |
| **Introduction**      | Ask students to observe objects shaped like triangles     |
| **Presentation**      | Explain types: equilateral, isosceles, scalene            |
| **Demonstration**     | Draw and label types of triangles                         |
| **Practice**          | Students draw and classify triangles                      |
| **Evaluation**        | Quick oral questions + diagram identification             |
| **Homework**          | Draw 3 triangle types and write definitions               |

📝 *Real-life Classroom Use:*  
This lesson can be delivered in a 30-minute class. The teacher uses visuals and structured explanation, and students respond individually or in pairs.

| When to use Teacher-Centered | For clarity, control, content-heavy or large classes                     |
| Direct Instruction         | Step-by-step teaching; best for factual/procedural content                 |
| Concept Teaching           | Teaching abstract ideas with examples and non-examples                     |
| Presenting and Explaining  | Structured oral or visual explanation of content                           |
| Sample Lesson Plan         | Structured plan with introduction, presentation, practice, evaluation      |

> **Exam Tip**: Be ready to write short notes on all three methods, justify when to use them, and develop or explain a full lesson plan using any teacher-centered strategy.
