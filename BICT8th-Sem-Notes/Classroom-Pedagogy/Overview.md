# Unit 4: Instructional Techniques

This section outlines both general and specific instructional strategies to be used throughout the course. These techniques are designed to enhance student engagement, promote collaborative learning, and connect theory with practice in real Nepalese classroom settings.

---

## 4.1 General Techniques

The following general instructional techniques are applicable to all units of this course:

- **Direct Instruction** followed by discussion, sharing, and interaction.
- **Analyze and relate Nepalese school practices** to various pedagogical concepts to improve classroom implementation.
- **Student preparation** of relevant models or samples for in-class sharing.
- **Collaborative sharing and review** in small groups and whole-class discussions.
- **Home assignments and self-study** to reinforce understanding and independent learning.

📝 *Example:* After introducing the concept of cooperative learning, students observe a nearby school using group-based tasks and later reflect on its effectiveness in class.

## 4.2 Specific Instructional Techniques

Different **instructional strategies** are recommended for teaching specific units. These are adapted to fit both content and learner context.

### Unit-wise Activities and Techniques

- **Directed Reading Activity (DRA)**
- **KWL (Know – Want to know – Learned)**
- **Paired Reading and Paired Summarizing (PRPS)**

### ✅ **Unit 2: Teacher, Learners, and Classroom**

**Suggested Techniques:**
- **Direct Instruction** for delivering theoretical content
- **What? So what? Now what?** for reflective discussion  
- **Pens in the Middle** for collaborative problem-solving  
- **One Stay Others Stray** for sharing group insights  
- **Read – Summarize – Question (RSQ)** for comprehension checking
