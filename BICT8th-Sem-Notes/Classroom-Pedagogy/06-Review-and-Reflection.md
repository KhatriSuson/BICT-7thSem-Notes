## 6.1 Concept of Review and Reflection

### 🔄 Review
- Reviewing refers to **revisiting previously learned concepts** to reinforce understanding, clear doubts, and deepen knowledge.
- It can be **fun, interactive, or structured**, and supports **long-term retention**.

### 💭 Reflection
- Reflection is the process of **thinking critically about one's own learning, teaching, or experience**.
- Encourages learners and teachers to **identify strengths, weaknesses, improvements**, and **future goals**.

📝 *Real-life Example:*  
After completing a unit on cooperative learning, students write a short reflection on what they found challenging and how they contributed to their group. The teacher, too, reflects on what strategy worked best.

## 6.2 Strategies for Review and Reflection

### ✅ Question–Answer Pair
- Students pair up and **quiz each other** using prepared questions.
- Great for test revision.

📝 *Example:* Before an exam, students quiz each other on teaching methods.

---

### ✅ Classify – Categorize – Organize
- Students **sort information** into categories or sequences.
- Helps with **concept mapping and critical thinking**.

📝 *Example:* Sorting types of student-centered strategies into cooperative, problem-based, and learner-engaged.

---

### ✅ Relay
- A **team-based activity** where students pass information or questions like a relay race.
- Encourages **collaboration and quick thinking**.

📝 *Example:* Teams take turns answering parts of a multi-step math problem.

---

### ✅ Guess Who?
- Based on **clues**, students guess a person, concept, or term.
- Useful for reviewing definitions, theorists, or models.

📝 *Example:* “I developed the theory of multiple intelligences…” — Answer: Howard Gardner.

---

### ✅ Two Truths and a Lie
- Each student shares **two true facts and one false statement** about a topic.
- Others must identify the lie.

📝 *Example:* About constructivism — “It supports memorization.” (Lie)

---

### ✅ Snowballing
- Start with individual reflection, then **pair, share, and expand** to larger groups.
- Builds deep understanding and collaboration.

📝 *Example:* Reflect on a group activity, share in pairs, then join another pair for discussion.

---

### ✅ Question Ball
- A soft ball is passed around. Whoever catches answers or asks a question written on the ball.
- Encourages **participation and excitement**.

📝 *Example:* A “pedagogy ball” with questions like “Define direct instruction,” “Name one cooperative strategy.”

---

### ✅ Run to the Board
- Students **race to the board** to answer questions or write terms.
- Useful for **active review sessions**.

📝 *Example:* Teacher says a learning theory, students run and write its key proponent.

## 6.3 Reflective Approaches

### 🔹 Teacher Reflection
- Teachers analyze **what worked and what didn’t** after a lesson.  
- May use **lesson journals, feedback forms, or peer observations**.

### 🔹 Student Reflection
- Students write or share **what they learned, what challenged them, and what they want to improve**.
- Can use tools like:
  - Learning logs
  - Reflection journals
  - "What? So what? Now what?" framework

### 🔹 Peer Reflection
- Classmates give **constructive feedback** to each other.
- Encourages **collaborative improvement**.

📝 *Example:* After a peer teaching session, the class gives feedback to the presenter using a checklist.
