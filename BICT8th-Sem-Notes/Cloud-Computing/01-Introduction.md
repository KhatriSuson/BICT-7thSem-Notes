## 1.1 🕰️ History and Evolution of Cloud Computing

### Key Milestones:
- **1960s**: Concept of "time-sharing" on mainframes
- **1990s**: Rise of the internet and web hosting
- **2006**: **Amazon launched AWS**, the first mainstream cloud platform
- **Today**: Cloud is central to IT infrastructure globally

📝 *Real-life Example:*  
Netflix moved its infrastructure from on-premises data centers to **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** to improve scalability and reduce costs.

## 1.2 🧩 Characteristics of Cloud Computing

| Characteristic        | Description                                                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **On-Demand Self-Service** | Users can provision resources automatically without human interaction.      |
| **Broad Network Access**   | Services are accessible over the internet from various devices.              |
| **Resource Pooling**       | Providers serve multiple clients using shared infrastructure.               |
| **Rapid Elasticity**       | Resources can scale up/down instantly to meet demand.                      |
| **Measured Service**       | Usage is monitored and billed accordingly (pay-as-you-go).                  |

📝 *Example:* A startup can scale up its storage during product launch week and scale down later without upfront cost.

## 1.3 🖥️ Cloud vs. Traditional IT Infrastructure

| Feature                   | Traditional IT                          | Cloud Computing                    |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Capital Investment**    | High (hardware, setup)                  | Low (subscription-based)           |
| **Scalability**           | Limited                                 | Flexible & Instant                 |
| **Maintenance**           | Handled by in-house IT team             | Handled by cloud provider          |
| **Accessibility**         | Local network-based                     | Internet-based (global access)     |
| **Upgrades**              | Manual and time-consuming               | Automatic and seamless             |

📝 *Example:* Banks traditionally maintained in-house servers, but now many use **Microsoft Azure** for scalability and compliance.
