## 🔍 Key Concepts & Real-Life Examples

Myths are traditional stories that explain **cultural beliefs, morals, and origins**. They often feature gods, heroes, and supernatural events.  

📝 **Real-Life Example:**  
Think about **Superman**—his story has similarities to ancient myths, portraying him as a savior figure, much like Prometheus bringing fire to humanity.  

### **1.2 The Bhagavad Gita**  
A sacred Hindu scripture that discusses duty, righteousness, and self-realization. It teaches how to live ethically and make moral decisions.  

📝 **Real-Life Example:**  
The Gita's teachings on **duty** and **selflessness** can be seen in modern leaders like **Mahatma Gandhi**, who was deeply influenced by its philosophy in his fight for independence.  

### **1.3 The Necessity of Religion**  
This topic explores how religion has shaped societies, provided ethical guidance, and given people a sense of belonging.  

📝 **Real-Life Example:**  
Even in a secular world, religious values influence laws and traditions, like how Christmas is widely celebrated beyond its religious roots.

This section examines the **two dominant political ideologies**—liberalism and conservatism—and how they shape government policies.  

📝 **Real-Life Example:**

### **1.7 Themes of Existentialism**  
Examines existentialist philosophy, which questions **life’s meaning, freedom, and individual responsibility**.
