## 🔍 Key Concepts & Real-Life Examples  

### **5.1 What is Postmodernism?**  
**Postmodernism** (पोस्टमोडर्निजम) is a cultural, intellectual, and artistic movement that emerged as a reaction to modernism. It questions established norms, embraces diversity, and often challenges traditional structures of knowledge, truth, and identity.  

📝 **Real-Life Example:**  
In the world of architecture, **postmodernism** is seen in buildings like the **Portland Building** in Oregon, USA, which challenges modernist ideas of sleek, minimalist designs by embracing bright colors, ornamental details, and a sense of playfulness.

### **5.2 The Postmodern Mind**  
The **postmodern mind** refers to the way individuals in the postmodern era approach issues like **truth**, **identity**, and **meaning**. It rejects the idea of one universal truth and embraces multiple, subjective perspectives.  

📝 **Real-Life Example:**  
Consider how the **internet** has given rise to various **social media influencers**. These individuals build personal brands based on subjective experiences, highlighting the postmodern mindset where truth is flexible and shaped by individual narratives.

### **5.3 Basket of Dreams, Casket of Dreams: Deaths of Nepali Migrants Overseas**  
This section reflects on the painful realities faced by **Nepali migrants** (नेपाली आप्रवासी) who pursue better economic opportunities abroad but often face death and exploitation in the process. The **"Basket of Dreams, Casket of Dreams"** narrative highlights the tragic and bittersweet journey of these individuals.  

📝 **Real-Life Example:**  
Thousands of **Nepali migrant workers** have tragically lost their lives in countries like **Qatar** and **Saudi Arabia** while working in dangerous conditions to send money back home. These workers are often referred to as "modern-day slaves" due to poor working conditions and lack of basic rights. Their dreams of a better future are often shattered, making the **"basket of dreams"** a metaphor for hopes that never come true.
