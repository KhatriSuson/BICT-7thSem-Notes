# Python Programming Course: Expected Outcomes  

## By the End of This Course, Students Will:  

### 1. **Understand Python's Syntax and Concepts**  
#### Key Concepts:  
- Variables and Data Types: `int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`.  
- Control Structures: `if`, `else`, `elif`, and loops (`for`, `while`).  
- Functions: Parameters, return values, and scopes.  
- Error Handling: Using `try`, `except`, `finally`.  
- Libraries: Importing modules like `math`, `random`.  

#### Example:  
```python
# Calculate the factorial of a number
def factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        return "Invalid input"
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
Real-World Application:
Input validation in a user registration system to ensure valid entries like age or email format.
2. Apply Python Programming Techniques
Key Concepts:
Problem Solving: Breaking problems into smaller tasks.
String Manipulation: Slicing, concatenation, formatting.
File Handling: Reading and writing text files.
Algorithms: Sorting, searching, recursion.
Data Visualization: Basic charts with matplotlib.
Example:
python
Copy code
# Read a file and count word occurrences
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    words = file.read().split()
    word_count = {word: words.count(word) for word in set(words)}

print(word_count)
Real-World Application:
A text analyzer tool to calculate word frequencies for SEO purposes.
3. Organize and Manipulate Data
Key Concepts:
Data Structures: Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, and Sets.
Libraries:
Pandas for DataFrames.
NumPy for array-based computations.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing and inconsistent data.
Example:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Create and manipulate a DataFrame
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'], 'Age': [25, 30, 35]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Filter and display rows where age > 25
print(df[df['Age'] > 25])
Real-World Application:
Analyzing sales data to find trends and patterns.
4. Create Functional Applications with Database and GUI Features
Key Concepts:
Database Integration: CRUD operations using sqlite3.
GUI Development: Create interfaces with Tkinter.
Combine Database and GUI: Build apps with front-end and back-end integration.
Example:
python
Copy code
import sqlite3
from tkinter import Tk, Label, Button

# Database connection
conn = sqlite3.connect("students.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)")

# GUI
root = Tk()
root.title("Student Manager")
Label(root, text="Welcome to the Student Manager").pack()
Button(root, text="Exit", command=root.destroy).pack()

root.mainloop()
Real-World Application:
Building a student management system to track attendance and grades.
5. Use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Key Concepts:
Classes and Objects: Encapsulation of data and behavior.
Inheritance: Reusing code across related classes.
Polymorphism: Flexible interfaces for diverse implementations.
Modular Design: Splitting large programs into smaller, reusable modules.
Example:
python
Copy code
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

    def display_info(self):
        return f"Brand: {self.brand}, Model: {self.model}"

class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, brand, model, seats):
        super().__init__(brand, model)
        self.seats = seats

    def display_info(self):
        return super().display_info() + f", Seats: {self.seats}"

car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 5)
print(car.display_info())
Real-World Application:
Designing an inventory system for vehicles in a car rental company.
