# **Unit 1: Python Programming Fundamentals**

## **1.1 Python Introduction**
- **What is Python?**
  - Python is a high-level, interpreted, and dynamically-typed programming language.
  - Known for its **simplicity**, **readability**, and **versatility**.

- **Key Features:**
  - **Interpreted:** Executes code directly without compilation.
  - **Cross-Platform:** Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.
  - **Extensive Libraries:** Built-in modules for tasks like web development, data analysis, and more.

- **Applications:**
  - Web Development
  - Data Science & Machine Learning
  - Automation
  - GUI Development

---

## **1.2 Data Types and Type Conversion**
- **Common Data Types:**
  - `int` (Integer): Whole numbers (e.g., `5`, `-10`).
  - `float` (Floating Point): Numbers with decimals (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.01`).
  - `str` (String): Text (e.g., `"Hello, World!"`).
  - `bool` (Boolean): Represents `True` or `False`.

- **Type Conversion:**
  - Convert data between types using built-in functions:
    - `int("10")` → Converts a string to an integer.
    - `float("3.14")` → Converts a string to a float.
    - `str(42)` → Converts a number to a string.

---

## **1.3 Comments**
- **Purpose of Comments:**
  - Explain code for readability and maintainability.
  - Prevent specific code from executing.

- **Syntax:**
  - Single-line comment: 
    ```python
    # This is a comment
    ```
  - Multi-line comment:
    ```python
    """
    This is a 
    multi-line comment.
    """
    ```

## **1.4 Variables, Constants, Operators, and Performing Calculations**
- **Variables:**
  - Used to store data in memory.
  - Example: 
    ```python
    name = "Python"
    ```

- **Constants:**
  - Represent fixed values; typically written in uppercase.
  - Example: 
    ```python
    PI = 3.14
    ```

- **Operators:**
  - **Arithmetic:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
  - **Comparison:** `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
  - **Logical:** `and`, `or`, `not`

- **Performing Calculations:**
  - Use operators for math:
    ```python
    result = (10 + 5) * 3
    print(result)  # Output: 45
    ```

---

## **1.5 Reading Input from Keyboard**
- Use the `input()` function to take input as a string:
  ```python
  name = input("Enter your name: ")
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")

### 1.1 Python Introduction  
Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and extensive libraries. It is widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.  

#### Example:  
```python
# Basic Python Program
print("Welcome to Python Programming!")
1.2 Data Types and Type Conversion
Python has several built-in data types, such as:

int: Integer numbers
float: Decimal numbers
str: Strings or text
bool: Boolean (True/False)
Type conversion allows changing a variable's type, e.g., int() or str().

Example:
python
Copy code
# Type Conversion Example
number = "123"
converted_number = int(number)
print(type(converted_number))  # Output: <class 'int'>
1.3 Comments
Comments are used to describe code, making it more readable. Python supports:

Single-line comments: Start with #
Multi-line comments: Enclosed within """ or '''
Example:
python
Copy code
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a 
multi-line comment
"""
1.4 Variables, Constants, Operators, and Performing Calculations
Variables and Constants
Variables are used to store data. Constants are values that do not change during execution (by convention, written in uppercase).

Operators
Python supports various operators for calculations and operations, including:

Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %
Comparison Operators: >, <, ==, !=, >=, <=
Logical Operators: and, or, not
Example:
python
Copy code
# Using variables and performing calculations
PI = 3.14159  # Constant
radius = 5    # Variable
area = PI * radius ** 2
print("Area of the circle:", area)
1.5 Reading Input from Keyboard
The input() function reads input as a string from the user. It can be converted to other data types as needed.

Example:
python
Copy code
# Reading input from the user
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
1.6 Print Function and Displaying Formatted Output with F-strings
The print() function displays output to the console. F-strings (f"") are used for formatted output in Python 3.6 and later.

Example:
python
Copy code
# Displaying formatted output
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
Summary of Unit 1
Python Introduction: Understand Python's core philosophy.
Data Types and Type Conversion: Use various data types and perform conversions.
Comments: Improve code readability with comments.
Variables, Constants, and Operators: Store data and perform calculations.
Reading Input and Output: Use input() and print() for user interaction and display formatted results.
