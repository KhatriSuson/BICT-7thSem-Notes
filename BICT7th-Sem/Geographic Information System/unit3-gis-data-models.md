## 📖 **Topics Covered**

### 3.1 Raster Model and Structure
- **Definition:** A data model that represents spatial information using a grid of cells, where each cell has a value representing a specific attribute.  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Regular grid structure (rows and columns).  
  - Suitable for continuous data like elevation, temperature, and land cover.  
- **Real-Life Example:** Satellite imagery uses the raster model to display Earth's surface.  
- **Key Components:** Resolution, cell size, and pixel values.  
- **Helpful Resource:**

### 3.2 Vector Representation
- **Definition:** A data model that represents spatial features using points, lines, and polygons.  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Points represent discrete locations (e.g., wells).  
  - Lines represent linear features (e.g., roads, rivers).  
  - Polygons represent areas (e.g., land parcels, lakes).  
- **Real-Life Example:** A city map showing roads, buildings, and parks is based on vector representation.  
- **Advantages:** Precise representation of boundaries and complex geometries.

### 3.3 Surface Representation in Raster Model
- **Definition:** Using a grid-based structure to represent continuous surfaces.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) for terrain analysis.  
  - Temperature variation maps.  
- **Characteristics:** Smooth transitions between values make it ideal for continuous surfaces.  
- **Real-Life Example:** A DEM showing elevation changes across a mountainous region.

### 3.4 Surface Representation in Vector Model
- **Definition:** Representing surfaces using contours, polygons, or points derived from vector data.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Contour lines on topographic maps.  
  - Triangulated Irregular Networks (TINs) for terrain modeling.  
- **Characteristics:** Provides high precision but requires more complex data structures compared to raster.  
- **Real-Life Example:** A topographic map with contour lines showing elevation levels.  
- **Helpful Resource:**
