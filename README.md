## **Course Description**
The "Python Programming" course aims to impart knowledge of the basic concepts of Python programming and equip students with skills to solve problems using it. The course covers fundamental features of the language, including:
- Data types, operators, and control structures.
- Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples, and string manipulation.
- Functions, exception handling, and file handling.
- Object-oriented programming (OOP).
- Database programming and building graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

The course emphasizes practical application, with a focus on laboratory-based programming experiments rather than theoretical concepts.
